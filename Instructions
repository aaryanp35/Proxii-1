# Project: Alt-Real Estate Value Index (Zip-Based)

## 1. Purpose
An analytics engine that calculates neighborhood "Gentrification" and "Investment Potential" scores by scraping Google Maps POIs within a specific Zip Code.

API Key MAPS: AIzaSyCQ2L7zn1uJB4-qF2ceWJv5i9K2FWmr6vk
## 2. Core Logic (The "Brain")
- **Input:** 5-digit US Zip Code.
- **Process:**
    1. Geocode Zip Code to Lat/Lng coordinates.
    2. Scan a 3000m radius via Google Places API.
    3. Categorize establishments into "Growth Drivers" and "Risk Factors."
- **Weighting System:**
    - **Positive (+):** Specialty Coffee, Whole Foods/Organic Grocers, Pilates/Yoga, Boutique Gyms, Wine Bars.
    - **Negative (-):** Payday Loans, Pawn Shops, Fast Food Chains, Industrial Zones.
- **Output:** A normalized "Neighborhood Score" (0-100).

## 3. Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.
- **APIs:** Google Maps (Geocoding + Places).
- **Frontend Framework:** React + Tailwind CSS.
- **UI Design:** Managed via SuperDesign.dev (Internal IDE Design Agent).

## 4. Coding Instructions for Copilot
- Use `axios` for API calls.
- Implement a caching layer (simple JSON or Redis) to avoid redundant API hits per Zip Code.
- Ensure the scoring algorithm is modular so weights can be adjusted easily.
- Create a clean API endpoint: `GET /api/score/:zipcode`.

## 5. UI Requirements (For SuperDesign Integration)
- The UI will be designed visually using SuperDesign.dev.
- The logic must provide a JSON response compatible with a "Dashboard" view featuring:
    - A Score Circular Progress Bar.
    - A list of "Top Growth Indicators" found.
    - A Map View centered on the Zip Code.
